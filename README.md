# Interview Scheduler

Welcome to the interview scheduler app! This app allows for users to schedule interviews with mentors available. The app shows the user the schedule for the day as well as how many spots are left. A user can click on a day (default monday) and see the available spots and interviews already scheduled. The user can create, edit, or delete interviews which updates the spots remaining and shows up without refreshing.

The app uses react for functionality and axios for interaction with the database, and this app also includes tests from storyboard, jest and cypress.
